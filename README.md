# Automata 🤖

## Motivation

Time is of the essence and it would be wasteful to **not automate** stuff that have a clearly defined outcome. This repository houses the logic for maintaining my plugin docs, assets and more.

Think of it like the central point for all automated actions. This makes it easy to manage all my workflows across all repositories from one point.

### Current workflows

- Man pages and asset bundling for [p5.nvim](https://github.com/prjctimg/p5.nvim)
